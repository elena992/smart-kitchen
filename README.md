### Generate a Recipe from OpenAI
Using the OpenAI API, you can generate unique recipes based on the ingredients you input.
Also this functionality has two parts, first call to the API gives you the recipe and second call to the API gives you an image base on the response of API's first call.

Resources:

API to generate the recipes, https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/completion, same one than ChatGPT is using.

API to generate images based on the recipes, https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images, same one DALLÂ·E is using.

### Generate a Recipe by your own
At Smart Kitchen you can let your creativity soar and design your very own recipes. 
You can add to the provided form the name of the recipe, the ingredients, the method of preparation, the portions, notes and your own photo.
